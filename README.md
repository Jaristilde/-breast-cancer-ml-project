 Predicting breast cancer using machine learning
# 🧪 Breast Cancer Prediction (ML Project)

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on features from the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

## 📁 Files in This Repo

- `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with the full ML pipeline
- `[Dataset]_BreastCancer.csv` — Cleaned dataset used in the notebook
- `.gitignore` — Standard Python ignores
- `README.md` — You’re reading it!

## 📊 Problem Statement

We want to build a machine learning model that can help doctors identify if a breast tumor is likely to be **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)** using real-world data.

## 📌 Methods Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Model training using `RandomForestClassifier`
- Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report

## 📈 Key Results

- Achieved >90% accuracy on test data
- Model is interpretable and practical for real-world use

## 🧠 How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Open `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
